# Seattle_House_Market
In this project we conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset we are dealing with and followed that with data manipulation and data cleaning.
Our objective is to compare different models like Neural Networks, Linear Regression and XGBoost to predict the price of a house based on several features.
We concluded that using a dataset where the top 1% house prices were out (as they were very discrepant from the other prices) and using a Neural Network worked better.
